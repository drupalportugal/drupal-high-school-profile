QUICK START GUIDE
-----------------
1. Create a View.
2. Add a "Bulk operations" field if available (see technical details below).
3. Configure the field. There's a "Views Bulk Operations" fieldset where the
actions visible to the user are selected.
4. Go to the View page. VBO functionality should be present.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
The module relies on the Views 3 "form" feature available in all Views releases after May 28th 2011.
The checkbox is provided as a views field called "Bulk operations".
The field can use a relationship, allowing you to have a node view with
operations on node authors, for example.
Note that currently a View can only have one VBO field.
Even if the view has several VBO fields, only the first one found will be used.

The "Bulk operations" views field is available in Views for all entity base tables,
since VBO relies on entities directly and no longer has its own "object" abstraction.
The Entity API module is strongly recommended. If it is installed, VBO uses its
entity access and entity delete functionality.

There is Drush integration available, allowing you to run an action against the
resultset of any View that has the VBO field in its master display.

Operations are gathered from three sources:
1) Drupal Core Action API
2) hook_node_operations and hook_user_operations.
3) Rules 2 (preferred).
The module also allows to use Batch API or the Drupal Queue to process the selected entities, in order to avoid timeouts.

RULES 2 INTEGRATION
-------------------
The module can use (as an action) any defined Rules component that accepts an entity as the first parameter.
As a reminder, Rules components can be created at admin/config/workflow/rules/components.

EXAMPLE VIEWS
-------------
VBO comes with two default views, reimplementing the Content and User listings.
They are disabled by default. After enabling them at admin/structure/views
they can be accessed at admin/content2 and admin/people2.
